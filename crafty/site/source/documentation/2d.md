We are first going to do the simplest drawing you can do, a basic square.

```
Crafty.init(400, 400);
var square = Crafty.e('2D, Canvas, Color');
square.attr({
  x: 10,
  y: 10,
  w: 100,
  h: 100
}).color('red');
```

This creates a stage that is 400 pixels wide and high. Then we create a entity called `square` that we then say that is should be placed at 10 x coordiate and 10 y coordinate from the top left corner and that is shoudl be 100 pixels wide and high.

Now we have a red box showing up on the page, now we want it to move in 2D. In Crafty if we want something to move by itself we bind to a event called `EnterFrame`.

```
square.bind('EnterFrame', function(){
  this.rotation = this.rotation + 1;
});
```

Now we have bound to `EnterFrame` event, this will be triggered for ever frame which on normal browser speed is 60 times a second.

You will notice that it is rotating about the top left corner, we would like it to rotate about its center and to do that we have to use the [.origin()](http://craftyjs.com/api/2D.html#-origin) function.

```
square.origin("center")
```

So now the our whole example looks like this

```
Crafty.init(400, 400);

var square = Crafty.e('2D, Canvas, Color');
square.attr({
  x: 10,
  y: 10,
  w: 100,
  h: 100
}).color('red');

square.origin("center")

square.bind('EnterFrame', function(){
  this.rotation = this.rotation + 1;
});
```

We can make it move around by changing the x and y coordiantes directly like this

```
square.bind('EnterFrame', function(){
  this.rotation = this.rotation + 1;
  this.x = this.x + 1;
});
```

Now it is up to you to make it do what you want it to do!
